# The neural link between subjective value and decision entropy

Code repository for an fMRI study linking subjective value with inverse decision entropy (similar to confidence) in a mixed-gambles task [bioRxiv preprint](http://biorxiv.com). The original data, preprocessed in fMRIprep, was obtained from the [NARPS project](http://narps.info) ([bioRxiv preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/843193), [data repository](https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds001734.v1.0.4), and [Scientific Data descriptor](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0113-7)). Many thanks to the NARPS team and the (70) labs for making their data available.

## Requirements

The repository is divided into behavioral and fMRI analysis. Scripts are in python or bash. Requirements include Python 2.7 or above, FSL and python packages like...
